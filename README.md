## Naming Convention

* Commit_message will manifest the code functionality. So that if requires we can search code by name
* Make branch name after your name, and suffix three digits ```Ex NAME-001```
* Always commit to your branch and make changes in your directory.
* Never use name names like temp, test1, etc for naming your code.
* Attach your code complexity at the last line of your Script/Code as comment.
* Provide additional information required to run the program in form of comments in your Script/Code.
* Provide testcases in comments in your Script/Code.
